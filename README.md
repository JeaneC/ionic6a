Mobile App Documentation Will Go Here

This is ionic6 v2.0. This will remain a private repository for the security of ionic6.

The App Requires a login to access any part of the database, everyone with an ionic6 email should have their own pass.

This is a guest account login:

Username: guest@guest.com

Pass: guestpass


I'll explain my app via it's controllers, as I can't really think of a more organized way to explain them.


LoginVC and Site VC
- Simple Login page. I created accounts manually because we are a small group so far, and to prevent outsiders from creating accounts
- SiteVC just allows you to choose a site location


First Commit
- LoginVC and SiteVC are good to go.
